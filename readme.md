### *AWS Lambdas: Easy, Easier, Easiest* ###

_‚Äú**When not to choose AWS**
Where AWS becomes overkill are typical JAMstack apps. A static site with lots of frontend logic. Hosting those on AWS is a pain whereas Netlify and Vercel make them a core feature.‚Äù-***Swizec Teller***, [_Serverless Handbook: AWS, Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase?_](https://serverlesshandbook.dev/serverless-flavors/)_

**Serverless Quotes That Explain Well**

*‚ÄúYou can use Serverless Functions to solve (almost) any backend needs you have without deploying and maintaining a server yourself.‚Äù*
-***Dorcas Ferry***, [_Serverless Functions, Netlify vs Vercel, and the Jamstack_](https://morioh.com/p/dc014b3356d2)

*‚ÄúFor static content, everything is prebuilt and cached. For dynamic content, companies build microservices that are loaded on demand and that can scale easily.‚Äù*
-***Romain Dillet***, [_Cloudflare is testing a Netlify competitor to host Jamstack sites_](https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/cloudflare-is-testing-a-netlify-competitor-to-host-jamstack-sites/)


*‚ÄúUnlike Netlify, Vercel simplifies its serverless function signature by only accepting requests and responses as parameters, which is achieved by wrapping the original AWS Lambda environment and simplifying it only for serving content purposes. Brilliant idea!‚Äù*
-***Emrah Samdan***, [_Why do companies invent their own serverless functions?_](https://blog.thundra.io/why-do-companies-invent-their-own-serverless-functions)
